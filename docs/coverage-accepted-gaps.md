# Coverage Accepted Gaps

Last total: 79.9% (commit d7249b0, 2026-06-13)

## Workflow notes for future passes

- **Check existing tests before proposing new ones.** Don't propose a test based on function-level % alone — grep for the function name in `*_test.go` first. Most apparent gaps already have tests; the % anomaly is usually a coverage tool artifact.
- **Don't launch real `capture()` goroutines in coverage runs.** Tests that call `handleReload` with 2+ webcams (or otherwise start the capture loop) cause non-deterministic instrumentation of large files and produce a net coverage *decrease*. The stagger sleep (`i>0` branch in `handleReload`) is an accepted gap for this reason.
- **Focus new-functionality passes on newly added functions.** Run `git diff <last-coverage-commit>..HEAD --name-only` to find changed files, then check only those functions against this gap list. Don't re-analyse the whole codebase.

## Integration territory / process lifecycle

- **`main.go: main()`** — OS process startup, flag parsing, signal handling; cannot be exercised as a unit test.
- **`main.go: newServer()`** — creates the real server with production dependencies (registry, storage, webview); integration-only.
- **`main.go: openLogFile()`** — opens a file on disk for logging; integration-only.
- **`main.go: newDayMaintenance()`** — long-running goroutine; cannot be unit-tested.
- **`main.go: printStartupSummary()`** — console output; integration-only.
- **`main.go: Enabled / Handle / WithAttrs / WithGroup`** — custom slog handler methods; exercised via the running server, not unit tests.

## Windows-only / hardware-dependent

- **`webview_windows.go: ensureSingleInstance / bringExistingWindowToFront / runUI`** — webview2 and mutex-based single-instance enforcement; requires Windows UI environment; build-tagged `//go:build windows`.
- **`webview_windows.go: showBrowserModeDialog`** — blocking modal TaskDialog; struct layout verified by `TestTaskDialogConfigSize`; dialog display and hyperlink-click path require a machine without WebView2 (see manual-test-checklist.md — "Browser-mode fallback").
- **`registry.go: readOrSetInstallDate()`** — reads/writes Windows registry; hardware-dependent.
- **`handlers.go: listDirectShowVideoDevices / parseDirectShowVideoDevices`** — queries DirectShow via ffmpeg; hardware-dependent.
- **`handlers.go: handleProbe`** — DirectShow device probe; hardware-dependent.
- **`capture.go: CaptureImage case "usb"`** — DirectShow capture via ffmpeg dshow; hardware-dependent.
- **`capture.go: CaptureImage case "stream"`** — RTSP/stream capture via ffmpeg; hardware-dependent.
- **`captureViaFfmpeg: store.Write error`** — requires ffmpeg failure with temp file present; hardware-dependent.

## Goroutine / long-running paths

- **`capture.go: capture() goroutine`** — long-running capture loop; goroutine startup errors and auto-suspend path not testable as unit tests.
- **`capture.go: capture.go:48 (SetCaptureTimes error at startup)`** — error path in goroutine startup; not simulatable without goroutine control.
- **`handlers.go: handleReload stagger (i>0 sleep)`** — `time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)` for 2+ webcams; launching real goroutines during coverage tests causes non-deterministic instrumentation; accepted as untestable without injectable sleep hook.

## Coverage tool artifacts (single-statement / column-number anomaly)

- **`config.go: Load()`** — single-call wrapper for `loadFrom`; 0% is coverage tool artifact (single-statement function with no instrumentation block generated).
- **`trial.go: capturesStopped / IsExpired / CapturesStopped`** — single-statement methods; coverage tool artifact.
- **`render.go: RenderError.Error() / Unwrap()`** — single-statement methods; coverage tool artifact.
- **`schedule.go: firstFutureCapture`** — function is directly tested in schedule_test.go but shows 0% due to large-file instrumentation artifact; classified as accepted gap.
- **`capture.go: recordSuccess`** — tested by TestRecordSuccess_resetsAllFields; 40% function coverage is a column-number artifact; all three assignments are executed.
- **`handlers.go: handleGetLatlong`** — function body is covered in tests but shows 0% due to position past ~660 lines in file; large-file instrumentation artifact.
- **`handlers.go: initTemplates`** — coverage varies non-deterministically between runs due to large-file instrumentation artifact.
- **`handlers.go: handleInfo`** — 50% is a coverage tool artifact for anonymous struct literal; test exists and makes a GET /info request.
- **`handlers.go: handleNew` parse-error blocks** — TestHandleNew_invalidLatitude etc. exist; 0-count blocks are column-number artifacts.

## Production clients (network-level)

- **`clients.go: NewHTTPTimezoneClient / NewHTTPSolarClient / NewHTTPImageFetcher`** — single-line constructors; 0% is tool artifact.
- **`clients.go: GetTimezone rate-limit retry`** — requires HTTP 429 from timezonedb.com; not simulatable without a network mock server.
- **`clients.go: GetTimezone / GetSolarTimes / Fetch non-200 / body-read errors`** — requires specific HTTP failure conditions; accepted as integration-territory.
